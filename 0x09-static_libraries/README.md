This is the static libraries readme. This project consists of 2 tasks.
The first task involves creating a library called libmy.a containing a lot of functions. A header file main.h contains the prototype of the functions used.
The second task involves writing a script that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files in the current directory.
